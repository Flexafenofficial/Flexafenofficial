**What is [Flexafen](https://sites.google.com/view/flexafen-mobility-reviews/home)?**
=====================================================================================

Flexafen is a nutritional supplement featuring a blend of collagen and other natural ingredients to relieve joint pain.

By taking Flexafen daily, you can purportedly stop your body from destroying its own joints – all with just 7 seconds per day.

Flexafen is marketed to people who have struggled to relieve joint pain through conventional methods. Some use dangerous and additive opioids, for example, while others use over-the-counter anti-inflammatory, topical creams, or low-quality supplements. These solutions may provide temporary relief, but they ignore the underlying cause of joint pain.

Whether dealing with severe and debilitating joint pain or occasional aches, Flexafen aims to be the ultimate joint pain relief supplement for anyone.

**[Flexafen](https://groups.google.com/g/flexafen-official/c/KQIaqrUFqhI) Benefits**
====================================================================================

Flexafen aims to deliver significant relief from joint pain with days or weeks – even if you have severe or debilitating joint pain. According to the official website, some customers struggled to walk or get out of bed before taking Flexafen. One reviewer claims he was able to stop using his cane to walk thanks to the supplement.

**How Does [Flexafen](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WClqSd9SLjm2tt2t4hhS6kELg2xnvQ8T) Work?**
========================================================================================================

Flexafen works using a blend of active ingredients in each capsule. The most important active ingredient in Flexafen, however, is the “peacemaker protein,” a specific type of collagen linked to joint health.

Collagen is the most abundant connective protein in the human body. It supports the area between your joints. It gives your skin its natural plumpness and support.

Over time, however, your collagen levels decrease, leading to joint pain and visible signs of aging. Some people take a collagen supplement to fight back.

**Why Take Flexafen Over Other Joint Pain Relief Solutions?**
=============================================================

Some people have found success with Flexafen after struggling with other joint pain relief methods. Conventional joint pain relief solutions – like over-the-counter mediation or prescription opioids – come with a range of issues.

Some of the reasons to take Flexafen over other joint pain relief solutions include:

Avoid expensive and time-consuming visits to the doctor

No risky surgeries

Avoid ineffective physical therapy

No more useless over-the-counter medication that damages your body

Avoid feeling like a burden or relying on others for help

Some people ignore their joint pain, causing them to be a burden to others. Others try invasive solutions like surgery or injections. Some resort to costly treatments or unproven supplements.

With Flexafen, however, you don’t need to do anything of these things. Instead, you can get powerful relief with just seven seconds per day.

**Who Created [Flexafen](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/332dd131-0ca2-4d71-9de2-94aa595cbc40)?**
===========================================================================================================

Flexafen was created by a man named Kevin Richardson, who describes himself as “one of the world’s leading independent medical health researchers.”

Over the past 21 years, Kevin has dedicated his life to identifying natural solutions to big pharma’s drugs and medications.

In fact, Kevin claims he has personally discovered natural solutions that have helped “over 86,191 people” get relief from various medical conditions. Kevin’s research has helped people improve their sleep and reduce their risk of heart attacks.

In recent years, however, Kevin has focused specifically on researching natural cures for joint pain. Kevin watched his mother struggle with debilitating joint pain – and the ensuing side effects of prescription medication from big pharma. He had a personal incentive to develop a natural cure for joint pain.

Kevin claims his recent breakthroughs on joint pain “are by far the most important discoveries I’ve ever made in my entire medical research career.” Kevin developed Flexafen based on those breakthroughs.

Kevin Discovered Joint Pain is Not Caused by Aging or Wear and Tear

Conventional medicine tells us joint pain is caused by aging or general wear and tear. As you get older, you overuse your joints, wearing down the cartilage between them and causing joint pain, leading to mobility issues and stiffness.

Kevin, however, has found a major problem with that theory. Here’s how he explains his breakthrough:

“We had been told that joint pain is caused by aging, and wear and tear…I found a major problem with that theory.”

Kevin was dissatisfied with that theory after analyzing scans of athletes and marathon runners. He discovered many of these athletes had overused their joints and eliminated all of their cartilage. Yet, despite having “bone on bone” contact and no cartilage, these athletes continued to compete at a high level.

“Over the past 20+ years of obsessively studying joint pain…I’ve seen hundreds of X-rays and MRIs…of lifelong athletes, marathon runners and Ironman competitors…who have worn their cartilage down to the point where you can’t even see any left…yet, despite their lack of cartilage…many of these athletes are still actively competing in marathons and triathlons…with zero physical pain.”

Meanwhile, people who aren’t nearly as active struggle to brush their teeth or take a shower. They haven’t used their joints nearly as much as marathon runners, yet they’re stiff and immobile.

Kevin realized there must be another root cause of joint pain beyond aging, wear and tear, and overuse. His research led him to discover “leaky joint syndrome.”

Flexafen is designed to target the root cause of joint pain and eliminate it, helping you resume living a normal, healthy, and active life.

You Have Joint Pain Because your Immune System is Targeting Your Joints

When you have leaky joint syndrome, your immune system is targeting your own joints.

Your immune system begins to treat your own joint collagen as an invader. Your immune system’s “surveillance cells” order the immune system to attack collagen leaking from your joints and the areas surrounding your joints.

When your immune system overreacts to this leaking collagen, it leads to noticeable symptoms of joint pain, including:

Damaged cartilage, bones, tendons, and ligaments

Pain

Swelling and stiffness

More collagen fibers leaking from your joints

Before long, according to the makers of Flexafen, there’s a “full-blown civil war” inside your body. Your own immune system is attacking your own joints, making it impossible to relieve joint pain no matter how much medication you take.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Flexafen Uses a Peacemaker Protein to Stop Joint Pain**
=========================================================

Kevin Richardson, the researcher who developed Flexafen, created the supplement based on a “peacemaker protein.” That protein has a special, triple helix structure that allows it to enter your body and eliminate the root cause of joint pain – leaky joint syndrome.

Here’s what happens when the peacemaker protein enters your body:

Each capsule of Flexafen contains a strong dose of the peacemaker protein, a specific protein linked to joint pain relief.

This peacemaker protein has a special, triple helix structure. This unique structure makes it different from ordinary collagen and other types of protein.

When you take the peacemaker protein in Flexafen, it slips into your body undetected, then reprograms your body’s defense system to stop attacking your own joints.

The triple helix structure of the peacemaker protein helps it pass the “surveillance cells” of your immune system. Normally, those surveillance cells order your immune system to attack all collagen – like the collagen leaking from your joints. With the peacemaker protein in Flexafen, your cells begin to recognize the peacemaker protein as an ally, fighting the root cause of joint pain.

After the peacemaker protein enters your body, your immune system stops detecting leaking collagen as an enemy. The peacemaker has “stopped the civil war” between your immune system and joints, allowing you to enjoy lasting relief from joint pain.

The peacemaker protein is backed by “dozens” of clinical studies. Over Kevin’s 21+ years of research into joint pain, he describes the peacemaker protein as one of the biggest breakthroughs he has ever made.

In one study, people reduced daily pain by 55% after taking the peacemaker protein for 90 days. That same group experienced significant relief from stiffness, pain, and overall quality of life within just 30 days of taking the peacemaker protein.

The Peacemaker Protein is Type II Collagen

**So what is the peacemaker protein? How does this miraculous molecule work? What’s inside each capsule of Flexafen?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main active ingred   ient in Flexafen is type II collagen, or the peacemaker protein.

You may have taken collagen before. However, most collagen supplements contain types I and III collagen. Many do not contain type II collagen.

Plus, most modern collagen supplements are hydrolyzed, or cut into small peptides. This may sound good for absorption, but it triggers your immune response, making joint pain worse.

The makers of Flexafen avoided hydrolyzing their collagen. Instead, they kept the type II collagen whole. The peacemaker protein has to remain hole to maintain its signature triple helix form. This form allows it to bypass your immune system and eliminate the root cause of joint pain: leaky joint syndrome.

Flexafen contains a specific, patented type of collagen protein made by Bioiberia, a Barcelona-based global life science company. That company makes Collavant n2, the best type of type II collagen in the world – and the solution to joint pain by acting as the peacemaker protein.

**Flexafen Ingredients**
========================

Flexafen contains a primary active ingredient – type II collagen or the peacemaker protein – along with a blend of other proven joint pain relief solutions.

Here are all of the ingredients in Flexafen and how they work, according to Kevin Richardson and his team:

Collavant n2 (Type II Collagen): Described as the “peacemaker protein,” Collavant n2 is a specific, high-quality version of type II collagen. Type II collagen has a unique, triple helix structure that helps it enter your bod undetected, sneaking past your immune system and targeting the root cause of “leaky joint syndrome.” It’s the most important active ingredient in Flexafen because it targets and eliminates the root cause of joint pain while giving you a valuable connective protein. One study found Collavant reduced joint pain in just 5 days when combined with Boswellia serrata extract, which is the next active ingredient in Flexafen.

**ApresFlex (Boswellia Serrata Extract):** Flexafen contains ApresFlex, or boswellia serrata extract. Boswellia serrata extract is found in a growing number of joint pain relief supplements. Studies show its active ingredient, boswellic acid, is rich with natural molecules to help relieve joint pain. It may have antioxidant effects, for example, to help with the inflammation associated with leaky joint syndrome. According to N-Labs, the boswellia serrata extract in Flexafen can help with joint pain, stiffness, and inflammation within just 5 days.

**Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM):** Flexafen contains methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), a popular joint pain relief supplement ingredient. In fact, at 250mg per serving, MSM is the largest ingredient in Flexafen. MSM can “significantly reduce joint pain and swelling,” according to the official Flexafen website.

**Sodium Hyaluronate:** Sodium hyaluronate is a version of hyaluronic acid, the popular moisturization molecule found in many joint pain relief supplements and similar formulas. Sodium hyaluronate can reduce joint inflammation, restore lubrication to dehydrated joints, and promote the synthesis of new cartilage, among other benefits.

**White Willow Bark Extract 4:**1: Flexafen contains white willow bark extract in a 4:1 concentration. It’s a powerful natural pain reliever linked to lower back pain relief, joint pain relief, reduced muscle pain, and reduced osteoarthritic pain, according to the manufacturer. In fact, some compare white willow bark to anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin – but without the side effects.

**Boron:** Flexafen contains a small dose of boron, although you only need a small amount to get your daily recommended intake. Boron is a naturally occurring mineral that reduces inflammation-causing enzymes, soothes pain, and eases the stiffness of troubled joints. It also stimulates healthy bone growth and the regeneration of cartilage, making it easier for your body to defend itself against joint pain.

Here are some of the reviews from joint pain sufferers:

One customer claims his doctor recommended taking Flexafen for his knee pain. He noticed a significant change within 2 weeks of taking Flexafen for the first time. He could walk better with Flexafen, and it didn’t hurt to sit for long periods of time anymore.

Another user claims Flexafen relieved stiffness, soreness, and pain in his knees within just 7-10 days of using it for the first time. Because of Flexafen’s effectiveness, he no longer needs to use acetaminophen for his arthritis pain.

One customer’s joint pain was so severe before taking Flexafen that she “could barely walk.” Now, after taking the supplement daily, she can easily do yard work and weed her garden.

Some customers have had success with Flexafen after unsuccessfully trying other products. One customer claims she tried 10 or 15 other products to treat her joint pain, but nothing worked until she started to use Flexafen.

One 79-year old woman claims she “felt an incredible difference” within just seven days of using Flexafen for the first time.

One customer had joint pain so severe that his right knee felt like bone on bone, and it was getting harder to walk every day. He even started to use a cane to walk. That 71-year old man was skeptical Flexafen would work because everyhting else failed. However, after taking just four pills, he “cannot believe how much better my knees feel.” He describes Flexafen as “like a miracle” even after just 4 days of use.

One 65-year old customer takes Flexafen every day and has “0 pain,” claiming the supplement changed her life. For years, she thought she had destroyed her knee and ruined any chances of mobility. Now, she can easily keep up with her grandkids.

A 71-year old customer from New York was skeptical about Flexafen after reading reviews. However, after taking Flexafen for just 3 weeks, he could stand up without pain for the first time in a long time. His stiffness has also improved.
